Brand South Africa’s Play Your Part corporate partner AECI is doing extraordinary work to help the ordinary. South Africa has been applauded by the World Health Organisation(WHO) for managing to control the spread of the Coronavirus far more successfully than developed countries to date. Since the announcement of the first COVID-19 case, the government has worked tirelessly to ensure that its citizens are protected, that the spread is carefully monitored and that tough decisions are made to protect the nation. The toughest action has been the nationwide lockdown, which has deeply challenged businesses and communities. Despite this, businesses have been working together with government to curb the spread of the virus. One such business that has rolled up its sleeves to ensure the war against the pandemic is won is AECI. AECI is a diversified Group of 16 companies. It has regional and international businesses in Africa, Europe, South East Asia, North America, South America and Australia. Products and services are provided to a broad spectrum of customers in the mining, water treatment, plant and animal health, food and beverage, infrastructure and general industrial sectors. As Brand South Africa’s corporate Play Your Part partner, AECI understands the importance of active citizenship and were among the very first to mobilise a rapid response plan with the mission to help the most vulnerable communities in the country. The AECI Group has invested over R 5 million rand in relief initiatives to address the vulnerable impacted by COVID-19. <img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-86417" src="https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG-20200419-WA0007-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG-20200419-WA0007-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG-20200419-WA0007-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG-20200419-WA0007-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG-20200419-WA0007-100x67.jpg 100w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG-20200419-WA0007-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG-20200419-WA0007-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG-20200419-WA0007-630x420.jpg 630w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG-20200419-WA0007.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />         These initiatives entail: In less than 30 days, and in the midst of the lockdown, AECI has already helped improve the circumstances of over 5 million South Africans by: Brand South Africa commends AECI for their selfless work done in our vulnerable communities.
