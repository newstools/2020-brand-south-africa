For more than half a year now, Africa’s tourism industry has been at a complete halt. Hotels and restaurants have been closed, attractions shuttered, land and sea ports almost closed and flights grounded. As CoVID-19 infection rates decrease, countries are steadily lifting their travel restrictions all around our beautiful continent. Many of the well-known destinations are commencing to reopen borders in an effort to restart their struggling tourism economies. I take a look at the African continent that is diverse and filled with a multitude of cultures, identities, beautiful nature and history.  Bloggers and travellers share their experiences from three countries in Africa, varying from cosmopolitan cities like Cape Town, getting up close with the camels in Namibia and enjoying the rich culture in Kenya proving that a journey through Africa is a ‘must have’ on your travel bucket list post CoVID-19. Kenya <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-87622" src="https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kenya.jpg" alt="" width="907" height="315" srcset="https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kenya.jpg 907w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kenya-300x104.jpg 300w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kenya-768x267.jpg 768w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kenya-100x35.jpg 100w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kenya-696x242.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px" /> Kenya showcases its people, diversity, food, culture, wildlife and landscapes.  The late Mzansi Girl who was a seasoned South African travel blogger and social media influencer, built up her Instagram page into a full high quality travel and leisure page packed with information, narratives and beautiful photography about Africa. She once shared her Kenyan escape experience and the only words I could use to describe her experience was ‘culturally phenomenal’. In her social media posts she recalls visiting a Masai village in Amboseli National Park and learning about their culture which was truly a special experience. Despite education, civilization and western influences, she expresses says that the Masai have clung to their traditional way of life, making them a symbol of Kenyan culture. She then challenged herself by rafting the rapids on the Tana River in central Kenya, one of the most thrilling activities on a river. The wild silty water provided many challenges with awesome guides expertly guiding   professionally and safely. An interesting fact she shared was the UK navy marines who regularly came whilst on their training. She was intrigued when she visited a small town on Lamu Island, which is a part of the Lamu Archipelago in Kenya, where donkeys have right of way because. the streets are way too narrow for vehicles. It is estimated that there are 6 000 donkeys on the island and only 2 cars. Donkeys are the primary means of transporting goods, people and are also used for agricultural purposes. The Annual Donkey Race is the highlight of the Lamu Cultural festival, hosted every November. Kenya has since August 1st reopened for international tourists. Entry requirements include bringing a negative PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test. Visit Kenya for an adventure in its purest form, Kenya safari tours are imbued with more than a century of nostalgia, steeped with tales of romantic journeys, perilous expeditions and pioneers of cultural conservation. Namibia <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-87623" src="https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Namibia.jpg" alt="" width="822" height="322" srcset="https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Namibia.jpg 822w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Namibia-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Namibia-768x301.jpg 768w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Namibia-100x39.jpg 100w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Namibia-696x273.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px" /> When you think of a desert, you think of an inaccessible location, not a person in sight, and ear-piercing silence. You may even wonder why on earth anyone would want to visit such a place. The Namibian deserts are surrounded by peace and serenity and rare beauty that leaves one astounded, with a deep soulful energy, inspiring experiences, courageous activities and thrilling encounters, what else would one want from a holiday destination? A serial traveller, 30-year-old Tebogo Masombuka who has made it her mission to travel the African continent shares her sandy but incredible crown birthday experience in Namibia with us. She spent her days sandboarding over the beautiful Namib desert dunes enjoying the landscape in a bold, venturesome way, quad biking in the desert which offered her a feeling of openness and unwavering space with the cherry on top being the camel ride across the desert. She described it as blissful while sailing through the desert with the peaceful animals. Namibia’s major airport reopened on 1 September 2020 and is now allowing foreign tourists to arrive. All arrivals need to bring a negative PCR test no older than 72 hours prior to arrival, and must be tested again after 7 days in Namibia (after completing 7 days’ quarantine). South Africa <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-87624" src="https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/South-Africa.jpg" alt="" width="826" height="304" srcset="https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/South-Africa.jpg 826w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/South-Africa-300x110.jpg 300w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/South-Africa-768x283.jpg 768w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/South-Africa-100x37.jpg 100w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/South-Africa-696x256.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" /> On a recent holiday to celebrate my 28th birthday, I visited Cape Town for the first time. The energy level of people there is unmatchable! On my tour, I covered the stretch from Stellenbosch to Franschoek, with the perfect ending in Cape Town. Captivating architecture, wine, food and culture – a fitting description of Stellenbosch! As South Africa’s second-oldest town, scattered granite hills and lush leafy vineyards arranged in lines, with arrow-straight paths leading up to various estates – so yes easily one of the best and most beautiful places I have been to in South Africa. If it’s wine tasting you are after in Stellenbosch, it’s wine tasting you will get, there are even ‘routes’ where you can take an exploration of different tastes and wines melded with amazing views and scenery. Another beautiful place to visit in Cape Town for wonderful views is Cape Point. It boasts some really spectacular scenery. An easy hike to the point, this rocky promontory offers amazing views, dramatic windswept ocean vistas, and a really remote experience. If you want the best views of the Cape, walk up to the lighthouse you will be amazed by the surrounding natural beauty. South Africa moved to Level 1 lockdown restrictions on 21 September 2020.
