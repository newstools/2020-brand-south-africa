It is even more critical now to empower women with the necessary skills and technology needed to fight this pandemic. “The National Integrated Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) Policy White Paper promotes the empowerment of women in the sector. However, in order for us to eradicate gender imbalance in the sector it is important that women are up-skilled and re-skilled in future skills including, block chain, Artificial Intelligence, machine learning among others,” said Ndabeni-Abrahams.
