As the country fights against COVID-19, food security has become a high priority for everyone. It is in the hands of every individual to ensure we leave no person impoverished. Young people have united in the name of humanity to improve their communities. A group of six young individuals hailing from KwaZulu-Natal’s third-largest city, Newcastle are playing their part through the Black Child Foundation; a non-profit organisation, which seeks to create a conducive environment for community development. The foundation was founded in 2017, with the aim of uplifting the community of Newcastle and surrounding areas, in Northern Natal. In a conversation with Brand South Africa, the Black Child Foundation team shares why they started the non-profit organisation. “We came together because we felt the need to engage with our youth on issues that affect them on a daily. Not only that, but to make sure we assist families and homes that are child-headed as well as elderly citizens with necessary resources”, explains Thamsanqa Ngubeni. “We know that we can’t help everyone, but we hope the best we can do will go a long way. We are creating a circle of givers, hoping that when one person is assisted, they can be able to pay that good deed forward. We empower our community to be great and to do great things with their lives,” adds Charmaine Mazibuko. <img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-87016" src="https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5217-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5217-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5217-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5217-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5217-100x67.jpg 100w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5217-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5217-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5217-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> <img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-87019" src="https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5248-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5248-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5248-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5248-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5248-100x67.jpg 100w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5248-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5248-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5248-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> <img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-87020" src="https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5274-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5274-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5274-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5274-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5274-100x67.jpg 100w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5274-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5274-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_5274-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />                           Conversations in the year 2020 can’t be concluded without the words coronavirus and pandemic and the impact it has caused in many communities.  As a foundation, “we have tried to do our bit in trying to curb the scourge of poverty that some are experiencing in our communities. We have donated over 120 grocery packs in our area so far. We have been very fortunate in getting assistance from businesses, professionals and individuals alike.” Brand South Africa echoes the importance of collaboration amongst civil society, business and government to help contribute to eliminating poverty and reducing inequality by 2030.  The likes of Black Child Foundation are playing their part to honour the ethos of Mandela day. Key programmes of the Black Child Foundation include: “We have previously partnered with Orange Grove Dairy and gathered the community of Section 3 in Madadeni, and gave away Amasi and yoghurt to residents who were in need,” shares Mr Ngubeni. “To be honest, nothing is easy about what we do. It can be emotionally and mentally draining, especially when you come across a really heart-breaking situation. But we always believe the work must be done. Government alone can’t do it, so we also become that bridge of assistance to our communities”, further shares Mr Ngubeni. Brand South Africa through its Play Your Part programme commends the Black Child Foundation for rolling up their sleeves, for being active citizens and living the legacy afforded to us by Nelson Mandela and the class of 1976. “We call ourselves ‘foot soldiers’ because we go out and we engage with the people, constantly. You need to know what people need, that would prevent protests, because you will be readily attending to people. It’s of course all a working progress for all of us. We all need each other, the one can’t work without the other”, concludes Ms Mazibuko All programmes and work done can be seen on the Black Child Foundation Facebook Page.
